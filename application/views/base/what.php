					<p>Christopher Cosentino is the founder and developer of Hybrid Fitness. A certified fitness professional for
						almost ten years, he has been studying various martial arts for 15 years. He holds a degree in Athletic
						Training, a division of sports medicine that focuses on caring, preventing and rehabilitating orthopedic
						injuries. </p>
					<p>Christopher's passion for Health, Fitness, and Martial Arts helped inspire him to create Hybrid Fitness.
						His knowledge of anatomy, physiology and exercise science provides him with the insight to create a more
						effective program design. A system such as this can best be defined as Training Evolved. It integrates the
						use of the body's multiple energy systems and an assortment of training methods provided conveniently for
						personal and professional use. </p>
					<p>Christopher has provided care for a range of athletes, from a high school level to NCAA division 1-3 and
						professional athletes. He has aided them in a rapid return to competition from nonsurgical and/or
						post-surgical injuries. When Christopher is not rehabilitating athletes back to health, he is putting them
						through intense training programs to prepare them for the demands of their sports and activities. </p>
